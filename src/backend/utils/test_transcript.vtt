00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.580
The smallest feline in the world

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.840
A rusty spotted cat

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.920
He may look like a kitten

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.380
Heâ€™d still fit in the palm of your hand

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.060
But this little male is very nearly fully grown

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.220
He'll soon be setting off on a solitary life

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.140
fending entirely for himself

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.240
What he lacks in size,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.420
he makes up for

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.880
in daring

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.880
Young cats are born curious

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.780
it's how they learn about their world

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.900
Even if it can get them into trouble

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.160
Straight away he puts his super senses through their paces

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.260
His eyes are six times more powerful than our own

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.240
and sensitive to the slightest movement
