# Vidify

Vidify will be a Chrome Extension, easily installed and instantaneously deployable. Our extension will provide a search bar, where users can type in key names of objects. Our extension will then parse the YouTube video and map object appearance to timestamps within the video. These timestamps will be returned to the user wherein the user will be able to quickly identify if the object appearance is accurate and to their satisfaction.




We're so back.
